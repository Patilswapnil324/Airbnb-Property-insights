Citywise property analysis of airbnb data

Created a dashboard using PowerBI to analyse the Airbnb property data in each city. This dashboard will be able to give the following insights:
1. Average cost of property in each region of a city by its property type, room type, and number of beds
2. Total revenue generated by AirBnB in each city
3. Number of properties in each city
4. The top city that is helping to generate more revenue
